if-gov-then-that
================

Idea: Promote gov APIs by making them dead simple and suggesting clever recipes (like IFTTT and Zapier)

rough brainstorming

* if census releases economic indicator above/below something
* I would say 'farmers market opens for the year' but think that the metadata for that API isn't parsed out well enough for that.  
* I wonder if it'd be possible to use the NREL API to power something that would alert you whenever there's a new alternative fuel station that opens within a certain geographic area...
* Maybe airport status (not quite the same as line times)?  E.G.  Triggers that are based off of an airport getting shut down.  I feel like many frequent flyers would be interested in getting a heads up of an event like this morning's at LAX for any airport in the lower 48, not just certain ones.  
* A we the people petition passes x number of signatures, includes x keywords

* Start by turning triggers into RSS feeds and promoting IFTTT recipes with them?
* GSA is working with IFTTT now... updates appreciated?
